# Bonfire.Label

Bonfire.Label is a powerful and flexible extension designed to enhance content moderation and improve online safety. Inspired by the design principles outlined by Prosocial Design (specifically the [Label Misleading Content & Add Links to Reliable Related Content](https://www.prosocialdesign.org/library/label-misleading-content-add-links-to-reliable-related-content) pattern), this library enables the addition of custom labels and descriptions to user-generated posts. This feature aids in identifying and marking potentially misleading, harmful, or unsafe content, while also providing users with links to reliable and related information.


## Features
- **Custom Labeling**: Easily add custom labels to posts, categorizing them based on content, reliability, and safety.
- **Dynamic Descriptions**: Append descriptions to posts to provide context, warnings, or additional information.
- **Link to Reliable Sources**: Option to include up to 3 links to authoritative sources for further reading or fact-checking.
- **Configurable Settings**: Tailor the permission system to fit the specific governance of your platform.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive tools for moderators and administrators to manage labels and descriptions.
